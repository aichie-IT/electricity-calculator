Electricity power, energy, and charge calculator in PHP plain (vanila)

This assessment is a simple electricity power, energy, and charge calculator developed using plain PHP (vanilla PHP). It calculates the power consumption (Wh), energy usage (kWh), and total electricity charge based on user inputs for voltage, current, usage hours, and the current tariff rate.

The calculator follows the standard formulas and tariff structure referenced from TNB (Tenaga Nasional Berhad). It is designed for learning, testing, and demonstration purposes, especially for understanding how basic electrical calculations are performed programmatically.
